## Description

The City of Madison has many [different
agencies](https://www.cityofmadison.com/agencies) providing a variety
of services.  In this project, you'll analyze real spending data from
2015 to 2018 for five of the largest agencies: police, fire, streets,
library, and parks.  You'll get practice calling functions from a
`project` module, which we'll provide, and practice writing your own
functions.

Start by downloading `project.py`, `test.py` and `madison.csv`.
Double check that these files don't get renamed by your browser (by
running `ls` in the terminal from your `p3` project directory).
You'll do all your work in a new `main.ipynb` notebook that you'll
create and hand in when you're done (please do not write your
functions in a separate .py file).  You'll test as usual by running
`python test.py` (or similar, depending on your laptop setup).  Before
handing in, please put the project, submitter, and partner info in a
comment in the first cell, in the same format you used for previous
projects (please continue doing so for all projects this semester).

We won't explain how to use the `project` module here (the code is in the
`project.py` file).  The lab this week is designed to teach you how it
works, so be sure to do the lab from home (if you missed it) before
starting the project.

This project consists of writing code to answer 20 questions.  If
you're answering a particular question in a cell in your notebook, you
need to put a comment in the cell so we know what you're answering.
For example, if you're answering question 13, the first line of your
cell should contain `#q13`.

## Dataset

The data looks like this:

agency_id|agency|2015|2016|2017|2018
------|------|------|------|------|------
5|police|68.06346877|71.32575615000002|73.24794765999998|77.87553504
6|fire|49.73757877|51.96834048|53.14405332|55.215007260000014
9|library|16.96543425|18.12552139|19.13634773|19.845065799999997
12|parks|18.371421039999998|19.159243279999995|19.316837019999994|19.7607100000000
15|streets|25.368879940000006|28.2286218|26.655754419999994|27.798933740000003

The dataset is in the `madison.csv` file.  We'll learn about CSV files
later in the semester.  For now, you should know this about them:
* it's easy to create them by exporting from Excel
* it's easy to use them in Python programs
* we'll give you a `project.py` module to help you extract data from CSV files until we teach you to do it directly yourself

All the numbers in the dataset are in millions of dollars.  Answer
questions in millions of dollars unless we specify otherwise.

## Requirements

You may not hardcode agency IDs in your code.  For example, if we ask
how much was spent on streets in 2015, you could obtain the answer
with this code: `get_spending(get_id("streets"), 2015)`.  If you don't
use `get_id` and instead use `get_spending(15, 2015)`, we'll deduct
points.

For some of the questions, we'll ask you to write (then use) a
function to compute the answer.  If you compute the answer without
creating the function we ask you to, we'll manually deduct points from
the `test.py` score when recording your final grade, even if the way
you did it produced the correct answer.

## Questions and Functions

### Q1: What is the agency ID of the library agency?

Hint: use `project.get_id("library")`

### Q2: How much did the agency with ID 5 spend in 2018?

It is OK to hardcode `5` in this case since we asked directly about
agency 5 (instead of about "police").

### Q3: How much did "streets" spend in 2016?

Hint: instead of repeatedly calling `project.get_id("streets")` (or
similar) for each function, you may wish to make these calls once at
the beginning of your notebook and save the results in variables,
something like this:

```python
streets_id = project.get_id("streets")
police_id = project.get_id("police")
fire_id = project.get_id("fire")
...
```

### Function 1: `year_max(year)`

This function will compute the maximum spending of any one agency in a
given year.  We'll give this one to you directly (you'll have to write
the code for the subsequent functions yourself).  Copy/paste this into
a cell in your notebook:

```python
def year_max(year):
    # grab the spending by each agency in the given year
    police_spending = project.get_spending(project.get_id("police"), year)
    fire_spending = project.get_spending(project.get_id("fire"), year)
    library_spending = project.get_spending(project.get_id("library"), year)
    parks_spending = project.get_spending(project.get_id("parks"), year)
    streets_spending = project.get_spending(project.get_id("streets"), year)

    # use builtin max function to get the largest of the five values
    return max(police_spending, fire_spending, library_spending, parks_spending, streets_spending)
```

### Q4: What was the most spent by a single agency in 2017?

Use `year_max` to answer this.

### Q5: What was the most spent by a single agency in 2018?

### Function 2: `agency_min(agency)`

We'll help you start this one, but you need to fill in the rest
yourself.

```python
def agency_min(agency):
    agency_id = project.get_id(agency)
    y15 = project.get_spending(agency_id, 2015)
    y16 = project.get_spending(agency_id, 2016)
    # grab the other years

    # use the min function (similar to the max function)
    # to get the minimum across the four years, and return
    # that value
```

This function will compute the minimum the given agency ever spent
over the course of a year.

### Q6: What was the least the fire agency ever spent in a year?

Use your `agency_min` function.

### Q7: What was the least that library ever spent in a year?

### Q8: What was the least that parks ever spent in a year?

### Function 3: `agency_avg(agency)`

This function will compute the average (over the four datapoints) that
the given agency spends per year.

Hint: start by copy/pasting `agency_min` and renaming your copy to
`agency_avg`.  Instead of computing the minimum of `y15`, `y16`, etc.,
compute the average of these by adding, then dividing by 4.

### Q9: How much is spent per year on streets, on average?

Use your `agency_avg` function.

### Q10: How much is spent per year on parks, on average?

### Q11: How much did the police spend above their average in 2018?

You should answer by giving a percent between 0 and 100, with no
percent sign.  In this case, your code should produce a number close
to `7.2249619343519145`.

### Function 4: `change_per_year(agency, start_year, end_year)`

This function returns the average increase in spending (could be
negative if there's a decrease) over the period from `start_year` to
`end_year` for the specified `agency`.

You can start from the following code:

```python
def change_per_year(agency, start_year=2015, end_year=2018):
     pass # TODO: replace this line with your code
```

Python requires all functions to have at least one line of code.  When
you don't have some code, yet, it's common for that line to be `pass`,
which does nothing.  Note the default arguments above.

We're not asking you to assume exponential growth or do anything fancy
here; you just need to compute the difference between spending in the
last year and the first year, then divide by the number of elapsed
years.

### Q12: how much has spending increased per year (on average) for parks from 2015 to 2018?

Use the default arguments (your call to `change_per_year` should only
pass one argument explicitly).

### Q13: how much has spending increased per year (on average) for streets from 2017 to 2018?

Use the default argument for the `end_year` parameter (your call to
`change_per_year` should only pass two arguments explicitly).

### Q14: how much has spending increased per year (on average) for streets from 2016 to 2018?

Note that a negative answer is expected (a negative increase represents a decrease).

### Function 5: `extrapolate(agency, year1, year2, year3)`

This function should compute the average change per year from the data
from `year1` to `year2` for `agency`, using your previous function for
finding average change.  It then returns the predicted spending in
`year3`, assuming spending continues increasing (or decreasing) by the
same constant amount each year.  We don't have anything for you to
copy for this one (you need to write it from scratch).

As an example, suppose spending in 2016 (year1) is 100 and spending in
2018 (year2) is 120.  The average increase is 10 per year.  So we
would extrapolate to 130 for 2019, 140 for 2020, etc.  This kind of
prediction is a simple *linear extrapolation*.

### Q15: how much will library spend in 2019?

Extrapolate to 2019 from the data between 2015 and 2018.

### Q16: how much will library spend in 2100?

Extrapolate from the data between 2015 and 2018.

### Q17: how much will library spend in 2100?

Extrapolate from the data between 2016 and 2018.

### Function 6: `extrapolate_error`

We can't know how well our simple extrapolations will perform in the
future (unless we wait 80 years), but we can do shorter extrapolations
to years for which we DO know the result.  For example, we can
extrapolate to 2018 from the 2015-to-2017 data, then compare our
extrapolation to the actual spending in 2018.

Write a function named `extrapolate_error` that does an extrapolation
using the `extrapolate` function and compares the extrapolation to the
actual result, returning the error (i.e., how much `extrapolate`
overestimated).  For example, if the extrapolation is 105 and the
actual is 110, then the function should return -5.

What parameters should `extrapolate_error` have?  That's your
decision!

### Q18: what is the error if we extrapolate to 2018 from the 2015-to-2017 data for police?

### Q19: what is the percent error if we extrapolate to 2018 from the 2015-to-2016 data for streets?

Percent error = extrapolate_error*100/actual_spending_of_the_agency_for_the_extrapolated_year

### Q20: what is the standard deviation for library spending over the 4 years?

Compute the population standard devation, as in [this example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation#Population_standard_deviation_of_grades_of_eight_students).
