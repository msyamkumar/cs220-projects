# Project 6: Wine Study
## Under Construction. Dont start working on it before release

## Corrections and Clarifications

* Oct 14: give better error when question cell has no output

## Introduction

This project is a wine connoisseurs' delight!  Data Science can help us understand people's drinking habits around the world.  For example, take a look at Mona Chalabi's analysis here: [Where Do People Drink The Most Beer, Wine And Spirits?](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dear-mona-followup-where-do-people-drink-the-most-beer-wine-and-spirits/)

For our part, we will be exploring a modified subset (the first 1501 rows) of the Kaggle
[wine reviews dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews);
you will be using various string manipulation functions that come with
Python as well as rolling some of your own to solve the problems
posed. Happy coding, and remember the [Ballmer
Peak](https://xkcd.com/323/) is nothing but a myth!

## Directions

Be sure to do lab 6 before starting this project; otherwise you
probably won't get far.

Begin by downloading `wine.csv` and `test.py`.  Create a `main.ipynb`
file to start answering the following questions, and remember to run
`test.py` often.  There is no `project.py` this week, though we'll
suggest some code in the lab that you can use to access the data.  Use
the `#qN` format as you have previously.

### Q1: which country names are listed in the `country` column of the dataset?

Your output should be in the form of a Python list containing the
country names.  The tests don't care about the order, but there should
should be no duplicate entries in the lists.  Also, some country names
are missing in the dataset (real-life data is often messy,
unfortunately!).  Missing values are represented as `None`, but you
should make sure `None` does not appear in your answer list.

Now is a good time to run the tests with `python test.py`.  If you did Q1 correctly, it should look like this:

```
Summary:
  Test 1: PASS
  Test 2: not found
  Test 3: not found
  Test 4: not found
  Test 5: not found
  Test 6: not found

  Test 8: not found
  Test 9: not found
  Test 10: not found
  Test 11: not found
  Test 12: not found
  Test 13: not found
  Test 14: not found
  Test 15: not found
  Test 16: not found
  Test 17: not found
  Test 18: not found
  Test 19: not found
  Test 20: not found

TOTAL SCORE: 5.00%
```

### Q2: what is the average points (rating) of wine?

Be careful!  There may be missing rating points information for some rows, so
it's best to skip those.

### Q3: List all wineries which produce wine in South Africa?

Answer in the form of a list containing no duplicates (for this and future questions).

### Q4: which wine varieties contain the phrase "caramelized" in the description?

This shoud match anything containing "caramelized (in any case), regardless of
spacing.

### Q5: which wine varieties contain the phrase "lemon-lime soda" in the description?


### Q6: which wine varieties contain the phrase "cherry-berry" in the description?

### Q7: which wine varieties are anagrams of the phrase "antibus governance"?

If you liked Professor Langdon's adventures in Da Vinci Code, you'll have fun with this one. :)

An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a
different word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once.
(Read more here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anagram).  For our
purposes, we'll ignore case and spaces when considering whether two
words are anagrams of each other.

Hint: although you'll need to loop over all the names to check for
anagrams, checking whether a single word is an anagram of another word
does not require writing a loop.  So if you're writing something
complicated, review the string methods and sequence operations to see
if there is a short, clever solution.

Consider writing a function to solve Q7 and Q8 with the same code.

### Q8: which wine varieties are anagrams of the phrase "Banned Petrol Mill".

### Q9: which winery produces the highest-priced wine in "US"?

Your answer should be in the form of a Python list.  If there is a
single best, that list should contain that single best variety.  If
multiple varieties tie for best, the list should contain all that tie.

Consider writing a function to solve Q9 and Q10 with the same code.

### Q10: what is the highest-rated wine variety made in "France"?

### Q11: what is the average points-per-dollar (PPD) ratio of the "Ponzi" winery?

In this question, we're trying to find the best value using the
`points` (the rating) and `price` (cost in dollars) columns.

Be careful!  You need to compute the ratio for each wine of the given
winery, then take the average of those ratios.  Simply dividing the
sum of all points by the sum of all prices will calculates the wrong
answer.

### Q12: what is the average PPD of the "Blue Farm" winery?

### Q13: which winery in New Zealand has the lowest average PPD?

Consider writing a function to answer this and Q14 and Q15 with the
same code. Make sure to return a string if there is only one winery having
the lowest PPD, otherwise return a list of wineries.
Hint: Suppose 'winery_list' is the list of all wineries having the lowest average PPD.
Now, check if the len(winery_list) is 1, then return winery_list[0], otherwise return winery_list.

### Q14: which winery in Australia has the lowest average PPD?

Careful, two wineries tie in this one!  Answer with a list containing
the names of the two wineries.

### Q15: which winery in Canada has the lowest average PPD?

### Q16: which wine varieties are produced by the "Global Wines" winery?

Produce a Python list with no duplicates.

### Q17: which wine varieties are produced by the "Quinta Nova de Nossa Senhora do Carmo" winery?

### Q18: what percentage of the varieties produced by "Global Wines" are also produced by "Quinta Nova de Nossa Senhora do Carmo"?
Quinta Nova wants to better understand their competition, so they
hired a savvy data scientist (you!) to keep an eye on the competition.

Suppose you are throwing a birthday party for your friends and family
guests. You decided to buy one bottle of the costliest wine in the US
for family guests and one of the cheapest wine for your friends (but
you promise your friends to treat with the costliest wine when you
get a job offer).

----

### Q19: what is the cost of cheapest wine that you could find in US?
Ignore the cells, which does not mention the price value.

### Q20: What is the total cost of buying the two bottles?

Cheers!
