# Lab 7: Dictionaries

In this lab, we'll practice using dictionaries in preperation for P7. 
Start a new scratch notebook to do the exercises.

## Exercises

### Counting Letters

Fill in the blanks so that `counts` becomes a dictionary where each
key is a character and the corresponding value is how many times it
appeared in `PI`.

```python
PI = "three, dot, one, four, one, five, nine, two, six, five, three, five, nine"
counts = {}
for char in ????:
    if not char in counts:
        counts[????] = ????
    else:
        ????[char] += ????
counts
```

If done correctly, you should see something like this:

```python
{'t': 4, 'h': 2, 'r': 3, 'e': 11, ',': 12, ' ': 12, 'd': 1, 'o': 5, 'n': 6, 'f': 4, 'u': 1, 'i': 6, 'v': 3, 'w': 1, 's': 1, 'x': 1}
```

### Counting Words

```python
PI = "three, dot, one, four, one, five, nine, two, six, five, three, five, nine"
counts = {}
for word in PI.????(????):
    if ????:
        ????
    else:
        ????
counts
```

If done correctly, you should see something like this:

```python
{'three': 2, 'dot': 1, 'one': 2, 'four': 1, 'five': 3, 'nine': 2, 'two': 1, 'six': 1}
```

### Dictionary from Two Lists

Fill in the blanks:

```python
keys = ["three", "zero", "one"]
vals = ["tres", "cero", "uno"]
en2sp = ???? # empty dictionary
for i in range(len(????)):
    en2sp[keys[????]] = ????
en2sp
```

The resulting dictionary should map the English words to the Spanish
words, like this:

```python
{'three': 'tres', 'zero': 'cero', 'one': 'uno'}
```

Try using your dictionary:

```python
words = "I love Comp Sci three zero one".split(" ")
for i in range(len(words)):
    default = words[i] # don't translate it
    words[i] = en2sp.get(words[i], default)
" ".join(words)
```

Not exactly going to replace Google translate any time soon, but it's
a start...

### Flipping Keys and Values

What if we want a dictionary to convert from Spanish back to English?
Complete the code:

```python
sp2en = {}
for en in en2sp:
    sp = ????
    sp2en[sp] = ????
sp2en
```

You should get this:

```python
{'tres': 'three', 'cero': 'zero', 'uno': 'one'}
```

### Dictionary Division

What if we want to do a lot of division, but we have all our
numerators in one dictionary and all our denominators in another?

```python
numerators = {"A": 1, "B": 2, "C": 3}
denominators = {"A": 2, "B": 4, "C": 4}
result = {}
for key in ????:
    result[????] = ????[key] / ????[key]
result
````

If done correctly, you should get `{'A': 0.5, 'B': 0.5, 'C': 0.75}`.

### Ordered Print

Complete the code so it prints the incidents per year, with earliest
year first, like this:

```python
incidents = {2016: 14, 2019: 18, 2017: 13, 2018: 16, 2014: 8, 2015: 10}
keys = sorted(list(????.keys()))
for k in ????:
    print(k, incidents[????])
```

```
2014 8
2015 10
2016 14
2017 13
2018 16
2019 18
```

### Histogram

Modify the above code so it prints a histogram with letters, like this:

```
2014 ********
2015 **********
2016 **************
2017 *************
2018 ****************
2019 ******************
```

### Dictionary Max

Complete the following to find the year with the most incidents:

```python
incidents = {2016: 14, 2019: 18, 2017: 13, 2018: 16, 2014: 8, 2015: 10}
best_key = None
for key in incidents:
    if best_key == None or incidents[????] > incidents[????]:
        best_key = ????
print("Year", best_key, "had", incidents[????], "incidents (the max)")
```
